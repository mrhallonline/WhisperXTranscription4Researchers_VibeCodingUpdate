# requirements.txt for WhisperXTranscription4Researchers
# Note: On macOS, pick the correct PyTorch wheel for your system (CPU vs MPS) from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# If you install PyTorch from the wheel recommended on pytorch.org, you can still use this file for the rest of the packages.

# Core pinned versions (known-to-work baseline)
numpy==1.26.3
whisperx==3.2.0

# PyTorch (pin to a specific version here if you want exact reproducibility).
# For macOS you may prefer to install torch via the wheel from pytorch.org rather than pip installing from this file.
# Example pinned set used in the notebook for CUDA systems (Windows/Linux):
# torch==2.3.0
# torchvision==0.18.0
# torchaudio==2.3.0

# Auxiliary dependencies
speechbrain
ipykernel
ipywidgets
charset-normalizer
pandas
nltk
plotly
matplotlib
webvtt-py
pypi-json
srt
python-dotenv
tqdm

# Optional: add pyannote if you plan to run diarization locally via pyannote
# pyannote.audio>=3.0.0

# Notes:
# - Install/upgrade pip before using this file: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# - To install using this file (excluding PyTorch wheel selection):
#     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# - If you want a fully pinned environment for macOS (including the exact PyTorch wheel), I can generate a
#   platform-specific install snippet or environment.yml (conda) that pins everything including pyannote.
