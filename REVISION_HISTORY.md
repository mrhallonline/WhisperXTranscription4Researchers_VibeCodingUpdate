# Revision History

This document tracks significant changes made to the WhisperX Transcription + Diarization Audio Processing project.

## Version 1.1 - Cross-Platform Compatibility Fix
**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Author:** AI Assistant  

### Changes Made

#### Problem Fixed
- **Issue:** `AttributeError: module 'torch._C' has no attribute '_cuda_setDevice'` error on Mac systems
- **Root Cause:** Code was attempting to use CUDA functions on Mac computers, which don't support CUDA

#### Solution Implemented
1. **Created new cross-platform configuration cell (Cell 7)** in `whisperXTranscription4Researchers_VCU.ipynb`
2. **Added conditional CUDA detection** using `torch.cuda.is_available()`
3. **Implemented platform-specific compute types:**
   - GPU (Windows/Linux): `float16` for faster processing
   - CPU (Mac): `float32` for better compatibility
4. **Added user feedback** to show which device and compute type is being used

#### Code Changes
```python
# Configuration - Cross-platform compatible
# Check if CUDA is available and set device accordingly
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch.cuda.set_device(0)  # Set GPU only if CUDA is available
    device = "cuda"
    compute_type = "float16"  # Use float16 for GPU processing
    print(f"Using GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
else:
    device = "cpu"
    compute_type = "float32"  # Use float32 for CPU processing
    print("Using CPU for processing")
```

#### Files Modified
- `whisperXTranscription4Researchers_VCU.ipynb` - Added new Cell 7 with cross-platform configuration
- `README.md` - Updated with Mac-specific setup instructions

#### Benefits
- ✅ **Mac Compatibility:** No more CUDA errors on Mac systems
- ✅ **Windows/Linux Compatibility:** Maintains GPU acceleration when available
- ✅ **Automatic Detection:** No manual configuration required
- ✅ **Optimal Performance:** Uses appropriate compute types for each platform
- ✅ **Clear Feedback:** Shows which device is being used

#### Usage Instructions
1. **For Mac users:** Use the new Cell 7 instead of the old configuration cell
2. **For Windows/Linux users:** The new cell automatically detects and uses GPU when available
3. **Execution order:** Run imports cell first, then the new configuration cell
